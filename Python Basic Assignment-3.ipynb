    "Q1.  Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans- Reusability, easy debugging, easy understanding, easy enhancment to existiting code are some of the main advantageous of        functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.  When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "Ans- When function is called, then only it will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3-  What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Ans- The def statement defines a function\n",
    "     syntax- def function_name(formal arguments):\n",
    "             function_body\n",
    "             \n",
    "Q4-  What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "Ans- A function is procedure to achieve a particular result. while function call is using this function to achive that task.                  def Fun_name(formal arguments):   # define function\n",
    "                function_body\n",
    "                 return\n",
    "\n",
    "             Fun_name(actual arguments)  # call\n",
    "             \n",
    "Q5-  How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans- One global and local scope there in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6-   What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans-  Local scope variable are not available or get destroyed after call returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7-   What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Ans-  When return executed, program execution control goes back to main control from where the function called. \n",
    "     It is possible to return single or multiple values.\n",
    "     \n",
    "Q8-  If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "Ans- Nothing / none.\n",
    "     \n",
    "Q9-   How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans-   A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable. If you want to refer to a global       variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global.\n",
    "       \n",
    "           x =10\n",
    "        def global():\n",
    "            global x   #use global keyword\n",
    "            x =11\n",
    "             print(x)\n",
    "            global()\n",
    "            \n",
    "Q10-  What is the data type of None?\n",
    "Ans-  The data type of None is NoneType\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11- What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "Ans- It is a way of making all contents ofanother module available to current program module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12- If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "Ans- import spam\n",
    "     spam.bacon()\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q13- What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "Ans- Use try except block.( Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause and use except block to handle the      error.\n",
    "                          ) \n",
    "Q14- What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "Ans- Error causing statement is in try block and if any error happens then execute except block."
